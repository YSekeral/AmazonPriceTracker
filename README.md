# AmazonPriceTracker
A simple Python script that tracks Amazon product prices in real-time and sends you an email notification when the price drops below your target.  Built using requests, BeautifulSoup, and smtplib. Just set your desired price and email info in the .env file â€” the bot takes care of the rest.
